Arduino Robot

	The objective of this project is to implement an autonomous robot. The robot will be given the basic functionality of moving straightforward and turning 90 degrees to the left upon detecting an object at a small threshold distance in front of it. The robot has also been provided with the additional remote-controlled functionality of being manually driven using a phone application which communicates with a Bluetooth module. The phone application offers two modes of control and also displays the sensory data of the rangefinder in a graph. The motivation behind this lab is to learn fundamental aspects of robotics, including motors and basic control as well as to advance our knowledge on Arduino, sensors/actuators, and physical computing.
